BUDDHISM AND FLUTTER TOGETHER, IS IT POSSIBLE?

One of the Buddhist teachings is that we should calm down and not try to fight our problems but make friends with them, and can we bring this concept to programming?

I know what you're thinking, and no, you don't have to hug your Setup when it gives a red screen lol 😂 😂😂 But what if the problem wasn't totally an enemy?

What if he could influence us to look for the solution instead of just complaining that the ListView doesn't fit on the screen! (Oops!, I think that was kind of personal 🤭) 😂

It would be awesome if he would be a little considerate of us and say, “Hey, this widget is huge, it doesn't fit here, how about fetching it from Stack OverFlow? “ And that's exactly what today's tip is about, let's make friends with that red screen that no one likes, after all, nothing red is good, my bank account says 😂 😂😂

Flutter has several specific functions for error handling, and the ones we will use are “FlutterError.OnError” and “ErrorWidget.Builder”

### FlutterError.OnError :
Responsible for handling errors known by flutter, such as an assert() error that does not allow coloring in the container when the BoxDecoration is different from null.

### ErrorWidget.Builder :
Responsible for build-related errors and tell what the error screen will look like, and what to do when a build error occurs.
